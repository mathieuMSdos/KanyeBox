### Context

A personnal project.

I made it just after learnt JavaScript vanilla (1 month and half course). It was to test my skills in JS vanilla, CSS, HTML.

### The project

It's like a mini game in which you can reproduce kanye west music beat with the keys of your keyboard.
There are two different version of the website with two different beats and you can switch with the button on the top of the page. 

### Built with

- Javascript vanilla
- CSS
- HTML


### Technical description/challenge

- It's a one page website. So all content is dynamically generated (animation, background video and transition)
- The keys on screen are generated from an array. So it's easy to change sounds of each keys. You have just to change the source of sound files.
